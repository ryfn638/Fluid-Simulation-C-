<h1> C# Fluid Simulation</h1>
<p> Just rewriting the python fluid simulation here. The code in python does work but its so awfully slow so im redoing it in c#</p>
<p> I could probably get the python one to run smoothly at 400 particles but since I want to run at 1000 particles its genuinely more efficient to just write it here</p>
